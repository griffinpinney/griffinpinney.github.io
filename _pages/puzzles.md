As an avid solver of puzzles of all kinds, I thought I'd create a place to detail my thoughts and performances on some of my favourite puzzles. Each section below is dedicated to a class of puzzles I solve regularly, containing a log of my thoughts and commentaries on past puzzles.

  <summary><strong>üß© Jane Street Monthly Puzzle</strong></summary>
  <p>
    I began solving the Jane Street monthly puzzles in February 2024 with my good friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/frederick-vu-79a970297" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fred Vu</a>, and haven‚Äôt missed a month since. These days, I occasionally collaborate with Fred Vu or <a href="https://www.kelly-su.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Su</a>, but I usually solve the puzzles solo.
  </p>
  
  <div><strong>Starting July 2025</strong>, I‚Äôll begin recording:</div>
  <ul>
    <li>My thoughts on the previous month‚Äôs puzzle</li>
    <li>Difficulty and enjoyment ratings</li>
    <li>A sometimes rough, sometimes detailed outline of how I approached and solved the puzzle</li>
  </ul>

  <summary><strong>üßÆ IBM Ponder This</strong></summary>
  <p>
    I began solving the IBM "Ponder This" monthly puzzles in August 2024, but I solve them less religiously than the Jane Street puzzles. Each of these puzzles also comes with a bonus problem, which is usually a slightly modified or scaled up version of the original. Strangely, the bonus problem seems to range in difficulty from significantly harder to much easier than the original problem, and I don't solve it every time I solve the base puzzle.
  </p>

  <div><strong>Starting July 2025</strong>, I‚Äôll begin recording:</div>
  <ul>
    <li>The same information as for the Jane Street puzzles, but only when I happen to have solved the previous month's puzzle</li>
  </ul>

  <summary><strong>üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Lovatts Daily Cryptic Crossword</strong></summary>
  <p>
    This is an <a href="https://lovattspuzzles.com/online-puzzles-competitions/daily-cryptic-crossword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online cryptic crossword</a> from Australia. The art of cryptic crossword solving was originally taught to me by my ninth grade teacher, and has stuck with me ever since. My rule is to never seek outside help; if I don't know the meaning of a word, I have to work it out from context.
  </p>

  <div><strong>Starting July 2025</strong>, I‚Äôll begin recording:</div>
  <ul>
    <li>My solving stats, including current streak and best time</li>
    <li>The best clues I encounter, including an explanation of their solutions</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Clue:</strong> Where the sea is lamer and the golden undergarment is labrador? (6)</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> France<br>
          <strong>Explanation:</strong> Where else would the sea be "la mer" and the golden undergarment be "la bra d'or"?
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Clue:</strong> Much more suitable for a pair of punters (6,3,6)</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> Better and better<br>
          <strong>Explanation:</strong> In Australia, a "punter" refers to someone who gambles or places bets. As such, a pair of punters can be interpreted as "better and better", which also means "much more suitable".

        <summary><strong>Clue:</strong> Admission of tardiness in quarantine (7)</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> Isolate<br>
          <strong>Explanation:</strong> To admit tardiness would be to say "I'm so late", or, in broken English, "I so late". When spoken aloud, this sounds like "isolate", which also means "quarantine".

        <summary><strong>Clue:</strong> Take the wrong way? (5)</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> Steal<br>
          <strong>Explanation:</strong> Nothing fancy here; stealing is quite literally just taking in wrong way.

        <summary><strong>Clue:</strong> Signature tune or the tune for egomaniacs? (5,4)</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> Theme song<br>
          <strong>Explanation:</strong> The tune for egomaniacs would be "the me song". Joining the first two words gives "theme song", which also means "signature tune".

        <summary><strong>Clue:</strong> Type of bars frequented by gymnasts (10)</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> Horizontal<br>
          <strong>Explanation:</strong> Just take it literally! (Horizontal bars is a gymnastics event.)

        <summary><strong>Clue:</strong> Unless (4)</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> More<br>
          <strong>Explanation:</strong> "un-less" ought to mean the opposite of "less", which is "more". This isn't really a conventional cryptic clue and nor does it come from Lovatts ‚Äî I wrote it myself a couple years back and I still think it's kind of nice.

  <div><strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> these clues aren't particularly clever, but I'm recording them here since they made me laugh.</div>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Clue:</strong> Book excerpt has page about ass (7)</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> Passage<br>
          <strong>Explanation:</strong> If you put "page" about "ass", you get "passage", which also means a book excerpt. Sounds like a great book, too!
        </p>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Clue:</strong> Add ass to ET's belongings (6)</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> Assets<br>
          <strong>Explanation:</strong> If you add "ass" to "ET's", you get "assets", which also means "belongings".
        </p>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>Clue:</strong> Divides into three to try sex, I hear (7)</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> Trisects<br>
          <strong>Explanation:</strong> "I hear" is a clue to say "try sex" aloud. This sounds like "trisects", which also means "divides into three".
        </p>
      </details>

    <li>
      <details>
        <summary><strong>Clue:</strong> Talked keenly about the nudes! (8)</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> Enthused<br>
          <strong>Explanation:</strong> "about" is a clue to anagram some letters. If you anagram the letters of "the nudes" you get "enthused", which also means "talked keenly about".
        </p>
      </details>
    </li>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary><strong>Clue:</strong> Hates de exams, man (7)</summary>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> Detests<br>
          <strong>Explanation:</strong> "tests" is another word for "exams", and putting this next to "de" gives "detests" which also means "hates". This one makes me laugh because the author seemed to go out of their way to make you read it in a Jamaican accent.

While not exactly a puzzle, I also like to challenge my mental arithmetic abilities on <a href="https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zetamac</a>. My personal best is a score of 108 on the default settings.
