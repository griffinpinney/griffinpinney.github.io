I have very mixed feelings on this one... comments and solution to come 8/1/2025.

Fun fact: it was me (or at least partially me) who led to the mathematical clarification being posted. Prior to this, it was unclear how to process and interpret all the information, especially the car trips being of "constant" length \\(N\\) (which seems to not be true after all), and what underlying process governed the "spawn points" of the cars in spacetime.
