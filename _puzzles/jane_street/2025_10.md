Well, this was one of the easiest Jane Street puzzles I've seen yet. It was still pretty cool, don't get me wrong — I just don't have much to say about it this month.

## The approach:

Fix \\(p\\), and let $$V : \{0,1,2,3,4\} \times \{0,1,2,3\} \to \mathbb{R}$$ denote the value function (i.e. expected score) for each state assuming optimal play (where the components correspond to ball count and strike count respectively). We similarly have functions $$x,y : \{0,1,2,3\} \times \{0,1,2\} \to [0,1]$$ denoting the batter's probability of swinging and the pitcher's probability of throwing a ball, and $$R : \{0,1,2,3\} \times \{0,1,2\} \to [0,1]$$ denoting the probability of reaching the state \\((3,2)\\) when starting from state \\((b,s)\\), all assuming optimal play.

One can recursively compute \\(x(b,s)\\), \\(y(b,s)\\), and \\(V(b,s)\\) from \\(V(b+1,s)\\) and \\(V(b,s+1)\\), so starting from \\(V(4,s) = 1\\) and \\(V(b,3) = 0\\), one easily obtains all values of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(V\\). (Note: x and y are characterised by giving unchanged expected scores assuming the opposite player makes either of the two available deterministic choices.) One can then recursively compute \\(R(b,s)\\) from \\(x(b,s)\\), \\(y(b,s)\\), \\(R(b+1,s)\\), and \\(R(b,s+1)\\), so starting from \\(R(3,2) = 1\\), one easily obtains all values of \\(R\\).

The above recursions can be coded in a simple Python function, expressing \\(q = R(0,0)\\) as a function of \\(p\\). The maximum of this function can then be found to the desired accuracy by any number of simple optimisation algorithms.
