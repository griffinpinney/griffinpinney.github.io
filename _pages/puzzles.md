As an avid solver of puzzles of all kinds, I thought I'd create a place to detail my thoughts and performances on some of my favourite puzzles. Each section below is dedicated to a class of puzzles I solve regularly, containing a log of my thoughts and commentaries on past puzzles.

  <summary><strong>üß© Jane Street Monthly Puzzle</strong></summary>
  <p>
    I began solving the Jane Street monthly puzzles in February 2024 with my good friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/frederick-vu-79a970297" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fred Vu</a>, and haven‚Äôt missed a month since. These days, I occasionally collaborate with Fred Vu or <a href="https://www.kelly-su.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Su</a>, but I usually solve the puzzles solo.
  </p>
  
  <div><strong>Starting July 2025</strong>, I‚Äôll begin recording:</div>
  <ul>
    <li>My thoughts on the previous month‚Äôs puzzle</li>
    <li>Difficulty and enjoyment ratings</li>
    <li>A sometimes rough, sometimes detailed outline of how I approached and solved the puzzle</li>
  </ul>

  <summary><strong>üßÆ IBM Ponder This</strong></summary>
  <p>
    I began solving the IBM "Ponder This" monthly puzzles in August 2024, but I solve them less religiously than the Jane Street puzzles. Each of these puzzles also comes with a bonus problem, which is usually a slightly modified or scaled up version of the original. Strangely, the bonus problem seems to range in difficulty from significantly harder than to much easier than the original problem, and I don't solve it every time I solve the base puzzle.
  </p>

  <div><strong>Starting July 2025</strong>, I‚Äôll begin recording:</div>
  <ul>
    <li>The same information as for the Jane Street puzzles, but only when I happen to have solved the previous month's puzzle</li>

  <p>
    This is an <a href="https://lovattspuzzles.com/online-puzzles-competitions/daily-cryptic-crossword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online cryptic crossword</a> from Australia. The art of cryptic crossword solving was originally taught to me by my ninth grade teacher, and has stuck with me ever since. My rule is to never seek outside help; if I don't know the meaning of a word, I have to work it out from context.
